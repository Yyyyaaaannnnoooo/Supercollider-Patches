# Supercollider Patches
This is a collection of messy patches, some documented, some not. Some are copied and adjusted for my performative style and some are invented. Were code from over developer has been used there is often a link to the source (if I did not forgot ðŸ˜¸).

## Live Shows Code
Inside the [performance](https://github.com/Yyyyaaaannnnoooo/Supercollider-Patches/performances) folder there are all of the patches that I used in live shows. I often route Supercollider into Ableton Live for final mastering and effects.

### [Dronecore](https://github.com/Yyyyaaaannnnoooo/Supercollider-Patches/performances/dronecore)
This patch was used for two performances one at [CTM](https://www.ctm-festival.de/activities/concerts-and-club-nights/event-detail/db-soundscape-concert-1) and for a live show at Radio Bollwerk. A recording can be found [here](https://soundcloud.com/radiobollwerk/younger-sibling-radio-bollwerk)

### [SC-to-OT](https://github.com/Yyyyaaaannnnoooo/Supercollider-Patches/performances/performances/SC-to-OT)
Is a super collider patch to interface with the Octatrack via MIDI messages sent with the super powerful `Pdef` sequencer within Supercollider. A recording of this patch performed live at [WURM](https://wurm.club) can be listened [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-25924719/co-live-wurm-27012024)
